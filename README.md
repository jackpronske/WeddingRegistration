Wedding registration application

Heading
Wedding Registration Webpage for guests of my wedding

Sub-Heading
My guests will receive an easy way to tell me if they wish to come, while giving me all the information I'll need for planning their attendance

Summary
This site allows you to fill out a form, (shop for gifts) or give donations via paypal, and has an Administration front end access through a password that allows me to check the stats of my current guests for planning purposes

Problem
Reaching out to everyone is tough, and organizing repsonses when I finally get them is even tougher.

Solution
This application stream lines the entire process by allowing people to come and register on their own time, and it will auto gather all information I need (email, address for paper invitations).
